\section{Introduction}
Sine waves are cool.
They can be used in a myriad of engineering and mathematics applications, such as fourier transforms, telecommunications, and many others. 
In this paper we aim to show the differences of sine waves when they have different frequencies, amplitudes and initial phases.

\section{System Model}
A sine wave is expressed as
\begin{equation}
    V(t) = A \sin(2\pi f t + \theta_0),
\end{equation}
where $V(t)$ is the value of the sine at a given time $t$, $A$ is the amplitude, $f$ is the frequency, in Hz, and $\theta_0$ is the initial phase, in radians.

In order to represent the parameters of different sine curves, we add a subscript with a number to each of the variables above. This way, if we are talking about the first sine wave parameters we would use $A_1$, $f_1$, and $\theta_{0,1}$ to represent its amplitude, frequency and initial phase, respectively.

\section{Proposed Approach}
We propose to show 2 different sine waves, and visualize the difference in frequency and amplitude in a graphical manner.

\section{Results}

We have built a Matlab simulation to show this differences. Table~\ref{tb:params} contains the simulation parameters.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \input{tables/params.tex}
\end{table}

As we can see in Fig.~\ref{fig:sine_waves}, the two sine waves are different, depending on $f$, $A$ and $\theta_0$.

\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
So, we can conclude that frequency, initial phase and amplitude influence a sine wave's behavior.
